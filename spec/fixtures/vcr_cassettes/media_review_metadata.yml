        reports that Neil Patrick Harris, an irresistibly wholesome television presence,
        has fallen deeply and helplessly into the gap that separates men from women,
        East from West, and celebrity from notoriety. There\\u2019s no need to fear
        for his safety, much less his identity. Quite the contrary.\\nPlaying an \\u201Cinternationally
        ignored song stylist\\u201D of undefinable gender in \\u201CHedwig and the
        Angry Inch,\\u201D Mr. Harris is in full command of who he is and, most excitingly,
        what he has become with this performance. That\\u2019s a bona fide Broadway
        star, the kind who can rule an audience with the blink of a sequined eyelid.\\nYou
        may have assumed that Mr. Harris had won that status already. As the indefatigably
        charming M.C. of the Tony Awards in recent years, he has given life and luster
        to a creaky ceremony. And he\\u2019s logged hours on Broadway stages before,
        notably in the 2004 revival of the Sondheim-Weidman musical \\u201CAssassins.\\u201D
        \\nBut he has never had to carry a full-scale production on his shoulders,
        as he does in \\u201CHedwig,\\u201D John Cameron Mitchell and Stephen Trask\\u2019
        s 1998 rock musical memoir, which opened at the Belasco Theater on Tuesday
        night. And while Mr. Harris may let you see him sweat as he struts, slithers
        and leaps through this shamelessly enjoyable show, rousingly directed by Michael
        Mayer (\\u201CSpring Awakening,\\u201D \\u201CAmerican Idiot\\u201D), he never
        makes it feel like heavy lifting.\\nMr. Harris is toting more than his own
        persona \\u2014 and a hefty assortment of diva wigs and costumes. He also
        carries the main responsibility for hoisting a taboo-flouting tale of life
        on the margins into the mainstream environs of Broadway. First staged in downtown
        Manhattan with Mr. Mitchell as its star, \\u201CHedwig\\u201D tells the story
        of an East German \\u201Cslip of a girlyboy\\u201D who becomes (almost) a
        woman, (almost) an American and (almost) a rock star.\\nFoulmouthed, electrically
        tuneful and furiously funny, with explicit descriptions of its title character\\u2019s
        bungled sex-change operation and erotic adventures, \\u201CHedwig\\u201D developed
        a cult following that kept it running off Broadway for two years, with subsequent
        production around the world.\\nStill, when the film version was released in
        2001, directed by and starring Mr. Mitchell, Stephen Holden began his review
        in The New York Times by asking, \\u201CIs the world ready for Hedwig?\\u201D
        The Angry Inch, after all, refers not only to Hedwig\\u2019s backup band,
        but also to what was left of her male genitalia after surgery.\\nIn the subsequent
        13 years, mainstream America has become more aware, if not always more welcoming,
        of people of fluid sexual identity, with Barneys New York presenting an entire
        ad campaign featuring transgender models. This season alone, Broadway has
        been host to many men in women\\u2019s clothes, from Mark Rylance as a countess
        in \\u201CTwelfth Night\\u201D to most of the cast of Harvey Fierstein\\u2019s
        \\u201CCasa Valentina.\\u201D\\nBut \\u201CHedwig\\u201D and Hedwig are neither
        cuddly nor (sorry, old girl) particularly pretty. The anger is as much a part
        of her makeup as the glitter. Pain has left her voice raw, and Mr. Trask\\u2019s
        music, at least as it was first heard, matched Hedwig\\u2019s rough edges.\\nWhat\\u2019s
        more, the whole point of Hedwig was that she wasn\\u2019t big time, unlike
        her much reviled, much missed former lover, Tommy Gnosis, a rock star who\\u2019s
        successfully rebooted his career (with Hedwig\\u2019s songs). How do you justify
        the advent of a tarnished never-was on the Great White Way?\\nWell, you start
        with a sassily tweaked script, which has the title character taking over the
        Belasco for one night \\u2014 following some, er, gentle persuasion of a Shubert
        Organization producer \\u2014 after the premature demise of its previous tenant,
        \\u201CHurt Locker: The Musical.\\u201D This allows the witty designer Julian
        Crouch to come up with a ludicrously extravagant set, which depicts a besieged
        cityscape frozen in midexplosion. And how about some naughty eye candy in
        the form of cartoon projections by Benjamin Pearcy for 59 Productions?\\nThen
        you bring in Mr. Harris, who had two hit series on television (\\u201CDoogie
        Howser, M.D.\\u201D and \\u201CHow I Met Your Mother\\u201D), to lure in less
        adventurous theatergoers. And you dress him up in fab over-the-top rock goddess
        outfits (by Arianne Phillips, stylist costumer to Madonna), with flashy wigs
        and makeup (by Mike Potter) to set off his familiar, sculptured face.\\nBut
        Mr. Harris has much more than marquee and recognition value. He also has a
        master entertainer\\u2019s gift for making the rough go down smoothly. And
        what might be distasteful from other mouths \\u2014 including raunchy double
        entendres that deserve (and receive) rimshots \\u2014 sounds delicious coming
        from his. From the moment his Hedwig makes her David Bowie-esque entrance,
        we\\u2019re his to do what he will.\\nThat includes a certain amount of manhandling,
        if I may use so sexist a verb. In song and guttural speech, Hedwig is an aggressive
        narrator. (Note to front-row audience members: Don\\u2019t wear anything expensive.)
        Supported by a scrappy six-member band \\u2014 which includes her oft-humiliated
        boyfriend, Yitzhak (an excellent Lena Hall) \\u2014 Hedwig confrontationally
        delivers a history that covers her East German childhood (she was born in
        1961), her seduction by an American soldier and her transplanted Kansas life
        as a blue-collar gal with red satin dreams.\\nThe musical numbers, which borrow
        loosely from the vernacular of glam rock, punk and R&B, are loud, for sure.
        As performed by Mr. Harris and Ms. Hall, they are also, improbably, as infectiously
        tuneful as anything else on Broadway now. (My personal favorite: \\u201CThe
        Origin of Love,\\u201D though every one\\u2019s a crowd pleaser.)\\nMr. Harris
        milks maximal variation from what is merely a serviceable tenor. His dance
        moves feel like such a natural extension of Hedwig\\u2019s confrontational
        personality that you forget that they\\u2019ve been carefully choreographed
        (by Spencer Liff).\\nSimilarly, you may feel that our Hedwig is improvising
        as she riffs on subjects that now include the history of the Belasco, social
        media and Anderson Cooper. She\\u2019s not; I checked the script later. Mr.
        Harris is giving a highly disciplined performance that has the graceful illusion
        of sometimes clumsy spontaneity. And while Hedwig\\u2019s assured performer\\u2019s
        mask may occasionally slip, it is only to reveal more of Hedwig, not Mr. Harris.\\nAnd
        what a lot there is to reveal. Hedwig\\u2019s persona may be as solid as the
        Berlin Wall she grew up behind. But such walls have a way of eventually tumbling
        down. As carefully lit by Kevin Adams, Hedwig\\u2019s face can suddenly look
        shockingly naked, even before the real stripping down that provides this show
        with its stirring climax. And you sense the deep fear of powerlessness behind
        this seeming genius of crowd control.\\nThe man playing Hedwig never loses
        control, though. With this show, Mr. Harris joins an elite club of musical-comedy
        male supernovas that has exactly one other member these days, Hugh Jackman.\\nHedwig,
        who loves a good (or bad) metaphor, is fond of saying that she\\u2019s both
        a bridge and a wall. Mr. Harris is primarily functioning as a bridge here:
        between the unorthodox and the conventional, the perceptions of male and female,
        and a stage and an audience. Crossing that bridge with him turns out to be
        one of the few unqualified pleasures of this Broadway spring.\\n\",\r\n    \"docSentiment\":
